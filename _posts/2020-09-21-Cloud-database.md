## Briefly describe the application, what does it do? And describe the code?

I created a REST API with Azure functions Using SQL, so I used HTTP triggeres type function for these APIs and Visual Studio 2019 to create this mini application.
The application can save names by sending a POST request and by sending a GET request we can get all the names in a list from the database using Azure functions.
