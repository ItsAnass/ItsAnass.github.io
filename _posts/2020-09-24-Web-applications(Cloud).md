## Briefly describe your application, what does it do?
A simple web application which uses an azure database where the database contains a table which consist  Id and a Name the application is used to store names in the cloud database.

## Describe the code?
I created a ASP.NET Web App using Visual studio to create my simple web app .
Since I already created a database in Azure the goal is to create some functions  and  connect the app to Azure database in order to save and get information from - to the database.
I started first by creating a Model class which will represent the information that will be available in the database which looks like this:
