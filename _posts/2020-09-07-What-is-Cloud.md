In short, cloud / cloud services mean that you save your documents, images and other data on an online server instead of on your computer.
The services offer different functions but have in common that you can access your content not only from your computer but from any device (computer, tablet, phone). The cloud also means that you can let colleagues have access to what you work with. You decide to what extent others should be able to edit or just read what you are doing. The opportunity to have more people working with the same document opens up for creative collaborations.


## What are the advantages and disadvantages of a Cloud?

There are a lot of things to keep in mind like, software updates are made gradually, so you always have the support of the latest tools. You avoid major updates that lead to extensive and sudden changes. Moreover,
all data is automatically saved in at least two dedicated and secure data center environments - located in different geographical locations.
Apart of that, in some cases it can be more expensive than on premise if the company needs more advanced cloud solutions than standard and it can also be a disadvantage that a cloud service is sometimes difficult to adapt to the company's specific needs. 


## Conclusion about the price survey?

As major cloud providers AWS, Azure, Google, and IBM continue to drop the prices of cloud instances, they have added discounting options, added instances, and dropped the billing increments, in some cases, to per second billing. On the other hand, cloud pricing comparison of AWS, Azure, and Google cloud has always been difficult due to the frequency with which prices change.
It’s true that such a variation may only have short-term value in terms of what you’ll pay today for cloud services, but it reveals crucial cost differences you may not have previously identified. And most importantly, it helps you in cloud cost management for your software development project.
