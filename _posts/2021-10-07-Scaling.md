Is scaling in horizontal or vertical can affect the strategy of the business? Well the way that computing resources are added to the infrastructure can be the difference between these two types of scaling. Moreover, vertical scaling means that we are adding more compute power to our existing instances, while in horizontal scaling  we get the additional capacity in a system by adding more instances to our environment, sharing the processing and memory workload across multiple devices. 


## How does it cost to have an Azure application that scales horizontally vs. vertically?

Generally vertical scaling has lower initial cost due to several reasons:
* The hardware in terms of efficiency per unit is cheaper.
* There is only one machine, software licensing and implementation is less expensive.
* Maintenance costs, including power, server racks, and cooling is reduced.

On the other hand, horizontal scaling offers protection against single points of failure, the fact that there is more than one node can increase the complexity of the maintenance protocol. You will also need to include virtualization software and load balancing for a proper operation.
Due to increased complexity, initial costs tend to be higher when implementing this solution.
